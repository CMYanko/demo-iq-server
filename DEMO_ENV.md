# Sonatype-Demo
Scripts meant to simplify the standup of IQ-Server and Nexus in Docker.

## Prerequisites
These scripts assume the following:
1. You have Docker installed locally
2. You have an active internet connection
3. You have been provided a license key by Sonatype

## Setup
1. Run demo-setup.sh
```bash
./demo-setup.sh
```
Inspecting the script we see it is making the directories for our persistent volumes and copying in the folder with a self signed cert for nexus to run HTTPS. Lastly it calls the docker-compose, the -d detaches it from the console output.
```bash
# Creates directories to be mounted to containers as volumes
mkdir ~/iq-data ~/nexus-data
cp -R ./nexus-ssl ~/nexus-ssl

# Stands up test environment
docker-compose up -d
```
To stop the environment
```bash
docker-compose down
```
The next time you run docker-compose up -d it will automatically check for new versions and update the container(s).
